              Chamas and I have both had a passion for food since we were young,
              and we've been fortunate enough to work in the culinary industry
              for several years. We both started out working in restaurants,
              where we learned the basics of cooking, food preparation, and
              customer service. Over time, we developed our skills and expertise
              and worked our way up to more challenging and rewarding roles.

              The idea for our food app came about when my friend and I were
              discussing the challenges of finding good food options that fit
              our busy lifestyles. We both lead hectic lives and often found
              ourselves relying on fast food or takeout, which left us feeling
              unsatisfied and unhealthy. We realized that there had to be a
              better way to find healthy, delicious, and convenient meals.
